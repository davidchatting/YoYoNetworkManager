# The Yo-Yo WiFi Manager Library
The Yo-Yo WiFi Manager Library is an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/download) Library that hosts rich web experiences using HTML and JavaScript on the [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) and [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) that simply integrate with external circuitry. Operating as a [captive portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal) hosted webpages can standalone without the dependency of the Internet. Alternatively, this can be used like the excellent [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) library to manage WiFi connectivity for IoT devices. In addition, with the Yo-Yo WiFi Manager Library peer-to-peer networks of devices can be simply configured and operate in concert through one webpage.

## Installation

~~The latest stable release of the library is available in the Arduino IDE Library Manager - search for "YoYoWiFiManager". Click install.~~

Alternatively, the library can be installed manually. First locate and open the `libraries` directory used by the Arduino IDE, then clone this repository (https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/YoYoNetworkManager) into that folder - this will create a new subfolder called `YoYoWiFiManager`.

The Yo-Yo WiFi Manager requires that either the Arduino core for the ESP8266 or ESP32 is installed - follow these instructions:

* ESP8266 - https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager
* ESP32 - https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md

### Sketch Data Folder Uploader Tool
* ESP8266 - https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp8266-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/
* ESP32 - https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/

## Endpoints
The following endpoints are built-in:

/yoyo/credentials GET + POST

/yoyo/networks GET

/yoyo/clients GET

/yoyo/peers GET

## Limitations
The Yo-Yo WiFi Manager works with 2.4GHz WiFi networks, but not 5GHz networks - neither ESP8266 or ESP32 support this technology.

## Authors
The library was developed by David Chatting ([@davidchatting](https://github.com/davidchatting)), Mike Vanis ([@mikevanis](https://github.com/mikevanis)) and Andy Sheen ([@andysheen](https://github.com/andysheen)) for the [Yoâ€“Yo Machines](https://www.yoyomachines.io/) project at the [Interaction Research Studio](https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio) - Goldsmiths, University of London.
